## Accordion Project

### React Interview Question 1

This project, **Accordion**, is part of my React katas that I use to sharpen my logic. The Accordion component provides two options:

1. **Single Selection Mode**: Each accordion can be opened and closed individually. Only one accordion can be open at a time.
2. **Multiple Selection Mode**: By clicking the "Multiple Selection" button, you can enable the mode where multiple accordions can be opened at the same time.

There is also a **Reset** button that resets the state, making the logic start from the beginning.

### Features

- **Single Selection**: Only one accordion is open at a time.
- **Multiple Selection**: Multiple accordions can be opened simultaneously.
- **Reset Functionality**: Resets the accordion state to its initial configuration.

This project serves as an exercise to enhance logic and state management skills in React.
