      <p className='mb-4'>
        The bar was a shithole, but it was my shithole. I stumbled in
        at 2 AM, the neon sign flickering like my last brain cell. The
        bartender, Joe, looked at me with those tired eyes. He knew. I
        knew. We all knew.
      </p>
      <p className='mb-4'>
        "The usual," I grunted, slumping onto a stool that had seen
        better decades. Joe slid a bottle my way. The beer was
        piss-warm, but it was wet. That's all that mattered in this
        godforsaken town.
      </p>
      <p className='mb-4'>
        I took a long pull, feeling the familiar burn. Outside, the
        world was going to hell. Inside, it was just me, Joe, and the
        roaches. I raised my bottle to them. At least the roaches
        would outlive us all.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I finished the last drop, I realized it might be my last
        beer ever. I laughed. It sounded like a dog choking on a bone.
        Fitting end for a dog's life. I stumbled out, leaving the
        empty bottle behind. It was the only legacy I'd ever have.
